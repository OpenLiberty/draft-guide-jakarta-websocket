== What you'll learn

https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket[Jakarta WebSockets^] enable dual communication between client and server endpoints. First, the clients make connection over to the server using HTTP. The server can boardcast messages to the clients. WebSockets differ from Server-Sent Events (SSE) that SSE is unidirectional from server to client whereas WebSockets are bidirectional. WebSockets also enable the functionality of real-time updates over a smaller bandwidth.

The application you will build in this guide consists of the `frontend` client service and the `system` server service. The scheduler in the `frontend` service sends messages to the `system` service every 10 seconds. The `system` service broadcasts messages to the `frontend` clients. The following diagram depicts the application that is used in this guide. 

image::architecture.png[Application architecture where system and client services uses Jakarta Websockets API to connect and communicate. align="center"]

You'll learn how to use Jakarta Websockets API to build the `system` service and the scheduler in the `frontend` service. The scheduler pushes messages to the `system` service. Then, the `system` service will broadcast messages to clients. You will also learn how to use JavaScrpt `WebSocket` object in HTML file to build websocket connenction, subscribe on different events, and display the broadcasting messages from the `system` service in a table.

// =================================================================================================
// Getting started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the projects that are provided inside:

[role='command']
```
git clone https://github.com/gkwan-ibm/draft-guide-jakarta-websocket.git
cd guide-jakarta-websocket
```

The `start` directory contains the starting project that you will build upon. 

The `finish` directory contains the finished project you will build. 

=== Try what you’ll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed. 

To try out the application, go to the finish directory and run the following Maven goal to build the `system` service and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl system liberty:run

```

Next, open another command-line session and run the following command to start the `frontend` service:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl frontend liberty:run
```

After you see the following message in both command-line sessions, both your services are ready.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer is ready to run a smarter planet. 
----

Check out the service at the http://localhost:9080 URL. See that the table is being updated for every 10 seconds. 

After you are finished checking out the application, stop both the `system` and `frontend` services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran them. Alternatively, you can run the following goals from the `finish` directory in another command-line session:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl system liberty:stop
mvn -pl frontend liberty:stop
----

// =================================================================================================
// Creating the WebSocket server service
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the WebSocket server service

In this section, you will create the `system` WebSocket server service that broadcasts messages to clients.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/draft-guide-jakarta-websocket/start
```
endif::[]

When you run Open Liberty in development mode, known as dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following command to start the `system` service in dev mode:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl system liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************
*     Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

The `system` service is responsible for handling the messages produced by the scheduler, building system load messages, and forwarding them to clients. This can be achieved by configuring the `system` service as a WebSocket `ServerEndpoint`.

----

The service can be configured as an endpoint using the [hotspot=serverEndpoint file=0]`@ServerEndpoint` annotation. Within this class, you will also define the lifecycle of different phases like establishing a connection, sending a message during the connection and closing the connection. This is achieved by the [hotspot=onOpen file=0]`@OnOpen`, [hotspot=onMessage file=0]`@OnMessage` and [hotspot=onClose file=0]`@OnClose` annotation respectively. There is also the [hotspot=onError file=0]`@OnError` annotation which is responsible for tackling the scenario in which the server is unable to establish a connection.

During the `OnOpen` phase, a message is displayed in the console stating that the server is connected to the session. Similarly, during in the `OnClose` phase, a message is displayed on the console stating that the sessions has been closed along with the reason. During `OnMessage` phase, the message received from the server is displayed on the console. Since the messages have to be sent as JSON objects, they have to encoded and decoded.

[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemLoadDecoder.java[]
----

This class decodes the String back into a JSON object. This is achieved using the [hotspot=decode file=2]`decode` method. It also adds a [hotspot=willDecode file=2]`willDecode` check to see if the String can be decoded into JSON object and returns a boolean value of either true or false.

// =================================================================================================

== Creating the frontend service

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin. 

In this section, you will configure the client in the `frontend` service to subscribe to events and display their contents in a UI. 

The front-end UI is a table where each row contains the time, system load and the memory usage od the `system` service. The HTML and styling for the UI is provided for you but you must populate the table with information that is received from the server. 

When you run OpenLiberty in development mode, known as dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start OpenLiberty in dev mode:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl frontend liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[source, role="no_copy"]

#Create the SystemClient class.#
`frontend/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/frontend/scheduler/SystemClient.java`
----

SystemClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/frontend/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/frontend/scheduler/SystemClient.java[]
----

Connection to a WebSocket endpoint can be established using the [hotspot=clientEndpoint file=0]`@ClientEndpoint` annotation. You can use the same lifecycle annotations that were used in the server endpoint such as [hotspot=onOpen file=0]`@OnOpen` and [hotspot=onMessage file=0]`@OnMessage`. The WebSocket container class here is used to connect to a specified URL. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the SystemLoadScheduler class.#
`frontend/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/frontend/scheduler/SystemLoadScheduler.java`
----

// File 1
SystemLoadScheduler.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/frontend/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/frontend/scheduler/SystemLoadScheduler.java[]
----

As discussed previously, the WebSocket server picks up messages from the scheduler every 10 seconds and broadcasts it to all the `frontend` clients. 

The init functions defines an object of the SystemClient class and establishes a connection between it and “ws://localhost:9081/systemLoad”

The sendSystemLoad sends a random String from {loadAverage, memoryUsage, both} to the Websocket server. 

Finally, the close function closes the connection between client and localhost. 

The latest version of most modern web browsers support Jakarta Web Sockets with the exception of Internet Explorer.

----

// File 2
index.html
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/frontend/src/main/webapp/index.html[]
----

The onopen and onerror functions are responsible for logging the events in the console where as the onmessage event is responsible for adding a row when the loadAverage and the memoryUsage is sent from the server. 

// =================================================================================================
// Running the application
// =================================================================================================

== Running the application

Once your application is up and running, open your browser and check out your `frontend` service by going to http://localhost:9080. 

Visit http://localhost:9080 again on a different browser and verify that both the UI sessions are being updated every 10 seconds.

SystemClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/system/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemClient.java[]
----

The SystemClient is very similar to the one created previously. You can use the same lifecycle annotations that were used in the server endpoint such as [hotspot=onOpen file=0]`@OnOpen` and [hotspot=onMessage file=0]`@OnMessage`. The WebSocket container class here is used to connect to a specified URL. During the `@OnMessage` lifecycle, the String message received is decoded into a JSON object which is passed to the verify method of the SystemServiceIT class. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the SystemServiceIT class.#
`system/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemServiceIT.java`
----

// File 0
SystemServiceIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/system/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemServiceIT.java[]
----

There are two tests that have to be created within this class to ensure correct functionality of the WebSocket application. The testSystem method initializes a count down latch followed by establishing a connection to the ws://localhost:9081/systemLoad URI. The client then sends a message to the WebSocket server. The count Down latch is then awaited on to be closed with a timeout of 5 seconds. The count of the countDown is then returned and is then confirmed to not be zero. 

Similarly, for the testSystemMultipleSessions initializes 3 instances of SystemClient out of which one sends a message to the WebSocket server. The count Down latch is then awaited on to be closed with a timeout of 5 seconds. The count of the countDown is then returned and is then confirmed to not be zero.

When you are done checking out the services, exit dev mode by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran the `system` and `frontend` services,  or by typing `q` and then pressing the `enter/return` key. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `start` directory in another command-line session for the `system` and `frontend` services:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl system liberty:stop
mvn -pl frontend liberty:stop
