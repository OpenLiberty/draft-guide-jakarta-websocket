NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to use Jakarta WebSockets API to stream messages between client and server services.

== What you'll learn

https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket[Jakarta WebSockets^] enable dual communication between client and server endpoints. First, the clients make connection over to the server using HTTP. The server can boardcast messages to the clients. WebSockets differ from Server-Sent Events (SSE) that SSE is unidirectional from server to client whereas WebSockets are bidirectional. WebSockets also enable the functionality of real-time updates over a smaller bandwidth.

The application you will build in this guide consists of the `frontend` client service and the `system` server service. The scheduler in the `frontend` service sends messages to the `system` service every 10 seconds. The `system` service broadcasts messages to the `frontend` clients. The following diagram depicts the application that is used in this guide. 

image::architecture.png[Application architecture where system and client services uses Jakarta Websockets API to connect and communicate. align="center"]

You'll learn how to use Jakarta Websockets API to build the `system` service and the scheduler in the `frontend` service. The scheduler pushes messages to the `system` service. Then, the `system` service will broadcast messages to clients. You will also learn how to use JavaScrpt `WebSocket` object in HTML file to build websocket connenction, subscribe on different events, and display the broadcasting messages from the `system` service in a table.

// =================================================================================================
// Getting started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the projects that are provided inside:

[role='command']
```
git clone https://github.com/gkwan-ibm/draft-guide-jakarta-websocket.git
cd guide-jakarta-websocket
```

The `start` directory contains the starting project that you will build upon. 

The `finish` directory contains the finished project you will build. 

=== Try what youâ€™ll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed. 

To try out the application, go to the finish directory and run the following Maven goal to build the `system` service and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl system liberty:run

```

Next, open another command-line session and run the following command to start the `frontend` service:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl frontend liberty:run
```

After you see the following message in both command-line sessions, both your services are ready.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer is ready to run a smarter planet. 
----

Check out the service at the http://localhost:9080 URL. See that the table is being updated for every 10 seconds. 

After you are finished checking out the application, stop both the `system` and `frontend` services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran them. Alternatively, you can run the following goals from the `finish` directory in another command-line session:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl system liberty:stop
mvn -pl frontend liberty:stop
----

// =================================================================================================
// Creating the WebSocket server service
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the WebSocket server service

In this section, you will create the `system` WebSocket server service that broadcasts messages to clients.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/draft-guide-jakarta-websocket/start
```
endif::[]

When you run Open Liberty in development mode, known as dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following command to start the `system` service in dev mode:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl system liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************
*     Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

The `system` service is responsible for handling the messages produced by the scheduler, building system load messages, and forwarding them to clients. This can be achieved by configuring the `system` service as a WebSocket `ServerEndpoint`.

----
 
Annotate the `SystemService` class with [hotspot=serverEndpoint file=0]`@ServerEndpoint` annotation to make it as a WebSocket server. The `@ServerEndpoint` annotation specifies the `value` attribute for the connection endpiont, the `encoders` attribute for the classes to encode messages, and the `decoders` attribute for classes to decode messages. Annotate the methods that define the WebSocket lifecycle like establishing a connection, receiving a message, and closing the connection with the [hotspot=onOpen file=0]`@OnOpen`, [hotspot=onMessage file=0]`@OnMessage` and [hotspot=onClose file=0]`@OnClose` annotations respectively. The method annotated with the [hotspot=onError file=0]`@OnError` annotation is responsible for tackling errors.

The [hotspot=onOpenMethod file=0]`onOpen()` method stores up the client sessions. The [hotspot=onCloseMethod file=0]`onClose()` method displays the reason of closing connection and removes the session from the client sessions.

The [hotspot=onMessageMethod file=0]`onMessage()` method is called when a client message is received through the parameter `option`. According to the [hotspot=loadAverage hotspot=memoryUsageOrBoth file=0]`option` value, construct a message with different values and boardcast the `JsonObject` message to the clients by the [hotspot=sendToAllSessions file=0]`sendToAllSessions()` method.

----
include::finish/system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemLoadEncoder.java[]
----

The [hotspot=SystemLoadEncoder file=1]`SystemLoadEncoder` class implements the `Encoder.Text` interface, accepts the `JsonObject` message, and converts the message to a string by the [hotspot=encode file=1]`encode()` override method.

include::finish/system/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemLoadDecoder.java[]
----

The [hotspot=SystemLoadDecoder file=2]`SystemLoadDecoder` class implements the `Decoder.Text` interface, accepts string message, and decodes the string back into a `JsonObject` by the [hotspot=decode file=2]`decode()` override method. The [hotspot=willDecode file=2]`willDecode()` override method checks whether the string can be decoded into JSON object and returns a boolean value.

== Creating the frontend service

In this section, you will create the WebSocket client that communicates with the WebSocket server, the scheduder that uses the WebSocket client to send messages to the server, and a HTML file that uses JavaScrpt `WebSocket` object to build websocket connenction, subscribe on different events, and display the broadcasting messages from the `system` service in a table.

On another command-line session, navigate to the `start` directory an run the following goal to start the `frontend` service in dev mode:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl frontend liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

include::finish/frontend/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/frontend/scheduler/SystemClient.java[]
----

Annotate the `SystemClient` class with [hotspot=clientEndpoint file=0]`@ClientEndpoint` annotation to make it as a WebSocket client. Create a constructor that uses the [hotspot=webSocketAPI file=0]`websocket` APIs to establish connection with the server. Annotate the `onOpen()` method with the [hotspot=onOpen file=0]`@OnOpen` annotation that persists the client session when the connection is established. Annotate the `onMessage()` method with the [hotspot=onMessage file=0]`@OnMessage` annotation that handles messages from the server.

#Create the SystemLoadScheduler class.#
`frontend/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/frontend/scheduler/SystemLoadScheduler.java`
----

// File 1
SystemLoadScheduler.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/frontend/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/frontend/scheduler/SystemLoadScheduler.java[]
----

The `SystemLoadScheduler` class uses the [hotspot=systemClient file=1]`SystemClient` class to establish a connection to the server by the `ws://localhost:9081/systemLoad` URI at the [hotspot=postConstruct file=1]`@PostConstruct` annotated method. The [hotspot=sendSystemLoad file=1]`sendSystemLoad()` method sends a random string from either [hotspot=messages file=1]`loadAverage`, [hotspot=messages file=1]`memoryUsage`, or [hotspot=messages file=1]`both` to the Websocket server every 10 seconds through the [hotspot=schedule file=1]`@Schedule` annotation.


Now, create the front-end UI where the images and styles for the UI are provided for you. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=2", subs="quotes"]

#Create the index.html file.#
`frontend/src/main/webapp/index.html`
----

// File 2
index.html
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/frontend/src/main/webapp/index.html[]
----

The `index.html` front-end UI displays a table which each row contains a time, system load and the memory usage of the `system` service. Use JavaScript [hotspot=73-74 file=2]`WebSocket` to establish a connection to the server by the `ws://localhost:9081/systemLoad` URI. The `webSocket.onopen` event is triggered when the connection is established. The `webSocket.onerror` event defines how to tackle errors. The `webSocket.onmessage` event receives message from the server and insert a row with data from the message into the table. Most modern web browsers support Jakarta WebSockets.


// =================================================================================================

// =================================================================================================

== Running the application

Once your application is up and running, open your browser and check out your `frontend` service by going to http://localhost:9080. 

Visit http://localhost:9080 again on a different browser and verify that both the UI sessions are being updated every 10 seconds.

include::finish/system/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemClient.java[]
----

The SystemClient is very similar to the one created previously. You can use the same lifecycle annotations that were used in the server endpoint such as [hotspot=onOpen file=0]`@OnOpen` and [hotspot=onMessage file=0]`@OnMessage`. The WebSocket container class here is used to connect to a specified URL. During the `@OnMessage` lifecycle, the String message received is decoded into a JSON object which is passed to the verify method of the SystemServiceIT class.

#Create the SystemServiceIT class.#

SystemServiceIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/system/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemServiceIT.java[]
----

There are two tests that have to be created within this class to ensure correct functionality of the WebSocket application. The testSystem method initializes a count down latch followed by establishing a connection to the ws://localhost:9081/systemLoad URI. The client then sends a message to the WebSocket server. The count Down latch is then awaited on to be closed with a timeout of 5 seconds. The count of the countDown is then returned and is then confirmed to not be zero. 

Similarly, for the testSystemMultipleSessions initializes 3 instances of SystemClient out of which one sends a message to the WebSocket server. The count Down latch is then awaited on to be closed with a timeout of 5 seconds. The count of the countDown is then returned and is then confirmed to not be zero.

When you are done checking out the services, exit dev mode by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran the `system` and `frontend` services,  or by typing `q` and then pressing the `enter/return` key. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `start` directory in another command-line session for the `system` and `frontend` services:

[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl system liberty:stop
mvn -pl frontend liberty:stop
